# eLinks-Data-Analysis

#### Purpose
eLinks is an enterprise networking company that provides a platform for organizations to communicate and collaborate. Many companies in diverse areas of business including manufacturers, producers, suppliers, retailers, transportation use eLinks. The management of eLinks has noticed that user engagement with the companyâ€™s platform appears to have dropped in the most recent days. The management is unsure whether this is actually the case, and if so, what possible reasons for drop in user activity may be.
My work is to find the issues and advice the management team. Draw the hypotheses based on given data and find out that actually user activity or engagement dropped recently or not. If it is actually dropped then check how significant it is and draw the possible reasons based on data analysis.
